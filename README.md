# MEAN-Belt-Petshelter

This is My MEAN STACK RED BELT Unmodularized, I prefer the unmodularized as I am able to see all the changes in same file but It is 
always good idea to learn other way as well.
This project uses Angular for front end routing, MongoDB for storing the data, used Postman to check the JSON response


Please have look at other assignment for modularized version
